## Name Meanings & Lore

- **Mortanox**: A fusion of _"Mors"_ (Latin for "death") and _"Nox"_ (Latin for "night"). Mortanox is a cursed warrior bound to eternal darkness, fighting for redemption.

- **Lucarii**: Derived from _"Lucra"_ or _"Lucrum"_ (Latin for "wealth" or "profit"). These golden coins represent both material gain and a piece of Mortanox's lost soul.

- **Vitalis**: From Latin meaning "life force" or "vital energy." In the game, this represents the player's health and essence — lose it all, and Mortanox fades into the shadows.

- **Veil of Mortanox**: Refers to the shadowy curse that hangs over Mortanox, veiling his past, future, and identity in mystery. The game is about slowly lifting that veil.
