##  Gameplay Overview

**Veil of Mortanox** follows the cursed hero **Mortanox** as he fights off dark creatures, collects Lucarii (coins), and defends his Vitalis (health) in a decaying world.

### Core Features

-  **Play as Mortanox** – a Latin-inspired cursed hero with smooth pixel animations
-  **Collect Lucarii** – In-game currency used for future upgrades and healing
-  **Vitalis System** – Health points with visual feedback (5 hearts to start)

-  **Lucarii Saving** – Coins saved between sessions using JSON files
-  **Pixel Art & Sound** – Original FL Studio music and Piskel/Photoshop pixel art (many assets are placeholders for now)
